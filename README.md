Core Concept
Kids learn to recognize coins and bills, understand their values, count money combinations, and make proper change through progressively challenging mini-games and real-world scenarios.
Game Mechanics
Learning Progression:
Level 1: Coin/Bill Recognition

Name That Money: Flash cards showing coins/bills - kids click the correct name
Value Match: Drag coins to their correct value numbers (penny = 1¢, nickel = 5¢, etc.)
Size & Color Sort: Arrange money by size or color to learn visual differences
Memory Game: Flip cards to match coins with their values

Level 2: Basic Counting

Piggy Bank Counter: Count identical coins (all pennies, all nickels)
Mixed Coin Counting: Count combinations starting simple (2 quarters + 3 dimes)
Bill Combinations: Count dollar bills mixed with coins
Speed Counting: Timed challenges for building fluency

Level 3: Making Amounts

Exact Change Challenge: "Make 37¢ using these coins"
Multiple Solutions: "How many ways can you make 25¢?"
Minimum Coins: "Make 67¢ using the fewest coins possible"
Bill Breaking: "You have a $5 bill and need to buy something for $3.25"

Interactive Scenarios:
Ice Cream Truck:

Menu Display: Items with clear prices (Ice cream = 75¢, Popsicle = 50¢)
Order Taking: Kid chooses item, game shows price
Payment: Drag correct coins/bills to pay
Change Calculation: If overpaid, calculate and give correct change

Arcade Token Exchange:

Token Values: Learn different denominations (1 token = 25¢, 5 tokens = $1)
Exchange Rates: Convert between tokens and real money
